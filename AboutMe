Greetings! I like rock sculptures that go beep boop and engineering things that utilize their beep boops effectively, in consideration of others who also want to make things with beep booping. 
I also like reading, writing, and learning. I like to write and plan on creating a novel. Hiroshi Mori is one of my favorite authors and my favorite genre is philosophical fiction. 
What interests me most about computer science is theory of computation and cellular automata. Greensboro is my hometown and supporting my family here is cool. 
I like discussing in various areas including anime and manga in which I give presentations on various topics. My favorite food is cabbage.

I am a CS Major at UNCG. I work at the hospital with covid patients. I have a girlfriend of 5 years and
we have a dog together. Her name is Luna and she is the best Australian Shepard you could ask for. I am
thinking of going into the data field primarily to manage databases and write applications that revolve
around databases. I just enjoy the structure to a database I find it soothing :).
