Greetings! I like rock sculptures that go beep boop and engineering things that utilize their beep boops effectively, in consideration of others who also want to make things with beep booping. 
I also like reading, writing, and learning. I like to write and plan on creating a novel. Hiroshi Mori is one of my favorite authors and my favorite genre is philosophical fiction. 
What interests me most about computer science is theory of computation and cellular automata. Greensboro is my hometown and supporting my family here is cool. 
I like discussing in various areas including anime and manga in which I give presentations on various topics. My favorite food is cabbage.

we have a dog together. Her name is Luna and she is the best Australian Shepard you could ask for. I am
thinking of going into the data field primarily to manage databases and write applications that revolve
around databases. I just enjoy the structure to a database I find it soothing :).

I am a Senior currently finishing my last year at UNCG. I am a CS major with a math minor, but I don't really know what field of CS I want to go into after I graduate.
Operating System design and Security are both very interesting to me though. I was born and raised in Raleigh but I've done alot of traveling. 
I wait tables so my weekends are normally spent inside of a chaotic restaurant. When I do havefreetime I love to go hiking/camping at Linville Gorge 
and I play Hearthstone when I can. (Add me on battle.net if you want to play, #Camden1643)
