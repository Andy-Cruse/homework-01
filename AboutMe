I am a software engineer. I have writing code since the 4th grade. I have a BA in Screenwriting from UNC-Chapel Hill, and an
MS in Comp Sci from UNCG. I have been coding professionally for over 20 years. I also spent time in the movie industry.
I have written a novel. I have 2 children. 1 is a high school freshman. The other is an Econ major at NC State. I am
currently remodeling my kitchen. It has consumed my life.
