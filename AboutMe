I am a software engineer. I have writing code since the 4th grade. I have a BA in Screenwriting from UNC-Chapel Hill, and an
MS in Comp Sci from UNCG. I have been coding professionally for over 20 years. I also spent time in the movie industry.
I have written a novel. I have 2 children. 1 is a high school freshman. The other is an Econ major at NC State. I am
currently remodeling my kitchen. It has consumed my life.

I am a junior at UNCG in Computer Science. My first BA is in Biology with a minor in Chemistry.
In my free time I like to play games or go fishing. I am currently working a full time job repairing laptops
but my goal is to become a software engineer after I graduate. My favorite fast food restaurant is chik-fil-a.
