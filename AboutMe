Sengthida Lorvan
----------------
Hi, I am Thida! If all goes well I should be graduating in December with a BS in Comp Sci with three minors, Chinese,
Math, and History. I enjoy reading, mainly fiction, as well as watching shows in my spare time. I like to binge so I
start reading/watching a lot of different things at once. I work as a student technician under Classroom Technology.
I help the teachers with their tech issues(hardware) within the classroom. After I graduate while trying to find a job
in the field I plan on honing my foreign language skills and attempt to be a translator.

Greetings! I like rock sculptures that go beep boop and engineering things that utilize their beep boops effectively, in consideration of others who also want to make things with beep booping. 
I also like reading, writing, and learning. I like to write and plan on creating a novel. Hiroshi Mori is one of my favorite authors and my favorite genre is philosophical fiction. 
What interests me most about computer science is theory of computation and cellular automata. Greensboro is my hometown and supporting my family here is cool. 
I like discussing in various areas including anime and manga in which I give presentations on various topics. My favorite food is cabbage.

I am a CS Major at UNCG. I work at the hospital with covid patients. I have a girlfriend of 5 years and
we have a dog together. Her name is Luna and she is the best Australian Shepard you could ask for. I am
thinking of going into the data field primarily to manage databases and write applications that revolve
around databases. I just enjoy the structure to a database I find it soothing :).

I am a sophomore Computer Science student at UNCG. I have been interested in the ins and outs of software and computing
since 3rd grade, and my course concentration in High School was in Digital Media. I have three siblings, two of whom are
in high school, while my sister is currently in Kindergarten. My ideal career path is a Professor in Computer Science,
after receiving either a Master's or Doctorate in Computer Science. 

Ian Holder
-----------
I am, I assume like many here, a Computer Science major. I am the youngest of four, and the most curious. 
Finding ways to take things apart into their component pieces, but not finding how to put them back together.
I have gotten into fountin pens recently, preferring Kaweco pens.
The type of hobby that I could not recommend unless spending hours tring to fix something that might be broken seems fun.
But generaly I play video games in my free time: Bioshock, Hades, The Outer Worlds, and CyberPunk 2077 to name a few.
Also I am tring to read through Terry Pratchett's Discworld books.

Michael Leonard

I am a Senior currently finishing my last year at UNCG. I am a CS major with a math minor, but I don't really know what field of CS I want to go into after I graduate.
Operating System design and Security are both very interesting to me though. I was born and raised in Raleigh but I've done alot of traveling. 
I wait tables so my weekends are normally spent inside of a chaotic restaurant. When I do havefreetime I love to go hiking/camping at Linville Gorge 
and I play Hearthstone when I can. (Add me on battle.net if you want to play, #Camden1643)   

Yikuan Du

Hello, I am a Junior Computer Science Major at UNCG. I'm originally from New Jersey, though I've lived in North Carolina for over 10 years. 
I love working with my hands, and one day I will finally get around to rebuilding a car engine myself from the ground up.
I also play Rocket League too much, and at one point I was one of the top 20 players in the world, but I play the game much more casually now.

Thomas Knepshield
-----------------
I am a Junior Computer Science major here at UNCG. I am from Louisville, KY and in Greensboro for college. I am a weather geek and
photographer in my free time. I will drive hours to look at clouds that may or may not drop a tornado (yet to see one). I am a member
of the Cross Country and Track team here. Also, I like to travel to different cities and spend time there. Ill run, find a restaurant
and walk around before heading to the next town. This summer I am taking on this along with national parks. In the future, I hope to
work with either weather models or freetime app development with a career in meteorology.

I am a Junior in the Computer Science Field at UNCG. I am from Roanoke Rapids, NC. I love to play basketball and play video games.
I grew up on video games where I can say nearly a quarter of the lessons I have learn are from games. One of my goals is to have 
the chance to work with a gaming company. I have been to many states on the east coast and would love to travel more out west
