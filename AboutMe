I am a CS Major at UNCG. I work at the hospital with covid patients. I have a girlfriend of 5 years and
we have a dog together. Her name is Luna and she is the best Australian Shepard you could ask for. I am
thinking of going into the data field primarily to manage databases and write applications that revolve
around databases. I just enjoy the structure to a database I find it soothing :).
