I have written a novel. I have 2 children. 1 is a high school freshman. The other is an Econ major at NC State. I am

Hi, I am Thida! If all goes well I should be graduating in December with a BS in Comp Sci with three minors, Chinese,
Math, and History. I enjoy reading, mainly fiction, as well as watching shows in my spare time. Lately all I've been
doing is school and work. I work as a student technician under Classroom Technology. I help the teachers with their
tech issues(hardware) within the classroom.
